Candil City. A city that only shines at night, a paradise for the powerful and a labyrinth for everyone else. Between lights, smoke, and broken promises, chance is the only law that still stands. But even that law has owners. Mafias govern from the shadows, pulling the country's strings like invisible puppeteers. In Candil City, one surname dominates all whispers: Siliari, the faceless family that controls power, money, and fear.

In the midst of this soulless metropolis, a young man heads to the All Can Casino, the heart of the city and the last place his father had been seen. A noir-style interactive fiction where decisions weigh as much as bets. All In combines branching narrative, mini-games, time challenges, and an original credit system that alters the course of the story.
