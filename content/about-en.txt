Jr. Game & Narrative Designer focused on creating meaningful player experiences through story, structure, and emotion. I approach design as a dialogue between gameplay and narrative — where every mechanic, choice, and detail serves the story. My work explores how interactive systems can express feeling, consequence, and human complexity.

I've worked on small independent projects exploring different genres — from mystery and suspense to romance — always with the goal of making players feel something real. My work and collaborations explore emotion, player choice, craft characters that feel alive and world-building through small but meaningful projects developed with engines like Unity, Godot, and Twine. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and refining my craft, creating experiences where story and gameplay truly connect.
