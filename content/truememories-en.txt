In the futuristic metropolis of Neo-Damasc, overflowing with lights and decadence, young people between 16 and 24 disappear without explanation, many returning with empty minds, stripped of their memories. Amid this climate of distrust and fear, siblings Lethe and Tizz embark on a search, but what begins as an investigation for truth becomes a confrontation with their own identity, the limits of memory, and the weight of the past.

Between neon lights, conspiracies, and moral dilemmas, True Memories explores the fragility of the human mind and the need to remember, even when truth hurts more than forgetting. A story that combines science fiction and psychological drama to reflect on memory, identity, and the loss of self in a world dominated by technological control.
