An introspective journey in isolation. What begins simply soon breaks down into something much deeper and more disturbing. Small anomalies, subtle decisions, and a growing sense of disorientation push you to question everything you think you understand, everything you must assimilate. Each choice opens a new route to the truth, but understanding everything may require going through the cycle more than once.

A narrative experience with psychological and existential tones, designed to provoke oppressive and intimate sensations through the protagonist's inner journey. The story is built with a cyclical and replayable structure, where each playthrough reveals different fragments of the tale and raises new questions.
